# A path "/chat-messages/{id}" that accepts DELETE requests
# The {id} in the path is the id of the record to delete
# Eg. DELETE /chat-messages/1 to delete the message with id 1
# Eg. DELETE /chat-messages/2 to delete the message with id 2
# Respond with a 204 No Content response code
# There is no body to your response (We donâ€™t want to leak information about deleted records)
# You will give the same response even if there is no message with that id or the message has already been deleted
# After this request is sent for a message, that message should never be served again (It's deleted)
# Note that the "X" next to each chat message will send a DELETE request for that message
